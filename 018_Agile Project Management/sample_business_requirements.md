# Cooking A Meal

## Executive Summary

In this guide we will be explaining on the most thorough ways to prepare a full course meal. This guide will cover all basic topics to food preparation, serving, and a complete run through of everyday hygiene.

## Business Objectives

This project is something that all individuals preparing for a meal should refer to when cooking for the family.  Our main goal is to make sure you understand each step for each course of the meal.

## Background

This project was started in order to maintain a functioning tradition which we all know as dinner. 

## Scope

This project is not in any way a joke or a way to waste time. We are commited to help every household enjoy family time at the table like we are meant to.

## Functional requirements

If anybody wants to really know, we only do this out of love for humanity, we see how times are changing and nobody seems to do a thing about it. So when we made this guideline to a full course meal, we only did it to ensure happiness in American homes where lives are not the same as in an older period of time. 


## Personnel requirements

A team of 10 is all I as a PM needed to complete this guideline, all individuals who helped are very much experienced with household cooking and are the most qualified to actually complete any sort of summary regarding food. 

## Delivery schedule

Every 3 days we had a small contest in between 2 groups of 5. Each time was different, sort of like a iron chef episode we managed to tackle all sorts of food styles, designs, tastes, and methods of prepapration.

## Other requirements
We are not going to force anybody to use this guideline at all, its all up to you. 

## Assumptions

Do not assume all meals in this guideline will be of your taste, we have included all variations of all sorts of cuisine from around the world, everybody can find their taste in this guideline.

## Limitations

Not alot of individuals may want to use this guideline and therefor we have no preocupation as to who we are letting use this structure for food preparation since our limitations to the project were minimal.

## Risks
The only risk to this project is anybody who does not adhere their mind fully to completing the task in front of them. Its all up to you really
